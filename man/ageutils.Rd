\arguments{
\item{ages}{\verb{[numeric]}.

Vector of age in years.

Double values are coerced to integer prior to categorisation / aggregation.

For \code{aggregate_age_counts()}, these must corresponding to the \code{counts} entry
and will defaults to 0:(N-1) where \code{N} is the number of counts present.

\code{ages} >= 200 are not permitted due to the internal implementation.}

\item{breaks}{\verb{[numeric]}.

1 or more non-negative cut points in increasing (strictly) order.

These correspond to the left hand side of the desired intervals (e.g. the
closed side of [x, y).

Double values are coerced to integer prior to categorisation.}

\item{lower_bounds, upper_bounds}{\verb{[integerish]}.

A pair of vectors representing the bounds of the intervals.

\code{lower_bounds} must be strictly less than \code{upper_bounds} and greater than or
equal to zero.

Missing (NA) bounds are not permitted.

Double vectors will be coerced to integer.}

\item{counts}{\verb{[numeric]}.

Vector of counts to be aggregated.}

\item{max_upper}{\verb{[integerish]}

Represents the maximum upper bounds permitted upon splitting the data.

Used to replace \code{Inf} upper bounds prior to splitting.

If any \code{upper_bound} is greater than \code{max_upper} the function will error.

Double vectors will be coerced to integer.}

\item{weights}{\verb{[numeric]}

Population weightings to apply for individual years.

If \code{NULL} (default) counts will be split evenly based on interval size.

If specified, must be of length \code{max_upper} and represent weights in the
range 0:(max_upper - 1).}

\value{
\code{cut_ages()}:
\itemize{
\item A data frame with an ordered factor column (\code{interval}), as well as columns
corresponding to the explicit bounds (\code{lower_bound} and \code{upper_bound}).
}

\code{split_interval_counts()}:
\itemize{
\item A data frame with entries \code{age} (in years) and \code{count}.
}

\code{aggregate_age_counts()} and \code{reaggregate_interval_counts()}:
\itemize{
\item A data frame with 4 entries; \code{interval}, \code{lower_bound}, \code{upper_bound} and
an associated \code{count}.
}
}
\description{
This help page documents the utility functions provided for working with
individual ages and associated intervals:
\itemize{
\item \code{cut_ages()} provides categorisation of ages based on specified breaks
which represent the left-hand interval limits. The resultant groupings will
span from the minimum break through to \code{Inf} and will always be closed on
the left and open on the right. Ages below the minimum break will be
returned as NA. As an example, if \code{breaks = c(0, 1, 10, 30)} the possible
groupings would be [0, 1), [1, 10), [10, 30) and [30, Inf). This is roughly
comparable to a call of \code{cut(ages, right = FALSE, breaks = c(limits, Inf))}
but with both the resultant interval and the start and end points returned
as entries in a list.
\item \code{split_interval_counts()} splits counts of a given age interval in to
counts for individual years based on a given weighting. Age intervals are
specified by their lower (closed) and upper (open) bounds, i.e. intervals
of the form [lower, upper).
\item \code{aggregate_age_counts()} provides aggregation of counts across ages (in
years). It is similar to a \code{cut()} and \code{tapply()} pattern but optimised for
speed over flexibility. Groupings are the same as in \code{ages_to_interval()}
and counts will be provided across all natural numbers grater than the
minimum break. Missing values, and those less than the minimum break, are
grouped as NA.
\item \code{reaggregate_interval_counts()} is equivalent to, but more efficient than,
a call to \code{split_interval_counts()} followed by \code{aggregate_age_counts()}.

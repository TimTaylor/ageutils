ageutils provides a collection of efficient functions for working with
individual ages and corresponding intervals. These functions allow for efficient
conversion of ages to intervals, aggregation of ages and associated counts and
the splitting of interval counts based on specified age distributions.

The development version of ageutils can be installed from GitHub with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

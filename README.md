ageutils provides a collection of efficient functions for working with
individual ages and corresponding intervals. These include functions for
efficient conversion from an age to an interval, aggregation of ages
with associated counts in to intervals and the splitting of interval
counts based on specified age distributions.

Note that similar functionality is/was found in the
[ympes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ympes) package. Going
forward, the intention is that this functionality will be removed from
ympes in favour of this, more focussed, package.

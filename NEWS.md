# ageutils 0.0.0.9000

Initial release of `ageutils` which provides a collection of efficient functions
for working with individual ages and corresponding intervals. These functions
allow for efficient conversion of ages to intervals, aggregation of ages with
associated counts and the splitting of interval counts based on specified age
distributions.

Functions are derived from those in the
[ympes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ympes) with the intention being to
remove these functions from that package in favour of this one going forward.
